<p><b>Hello, I'm Ven!</b> In front of you is a personal project I'm working on to  help me learn various parts of web development and self-hosting. 
<p>Pntry.net is a simple web application that I designed primarily for myself, but I want it to also be useful to others. 
    There are a number of apps out there that perform the function of managing the kitchen inventory,
    ranging from very simple to very complex, but none that I've tried strike the right balance of ease of use,
    feature completeness, and freedom from paywalls, ads, and other promotional bloat.
    Hence I decided to make my own. So far the process has been a lot of fun.</p>
    
<p>This web application is <b>free and open source</b>, and you can explore the source code on my <a href="https://github.com/venny-ven/pntry.net">GitHub page</a>. 
    I hope you enjoy using this site. You can message me directly on Discord <b>@venny_ven</b>. Ciao!</p>
